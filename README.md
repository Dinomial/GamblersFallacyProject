# Gambler's Fallacy Social Science Experiment for ENG101 

Hi there!
Here before you are three different folders:
* exe: holds a working exe file that you should be able to run on a windows machine
  - NOTE: You will need to download the whole folder to run the exe file
* src: which holds the original source code that can be looked over 
  - will require the Unity Game Engine to be installed to see everything together, but you should be able to look at the individual components, such as the code itself)
* docs: hold a template spreadsheet that can be used to replicate the experiment, along with the results of my experiment in a similar spreadsheet
