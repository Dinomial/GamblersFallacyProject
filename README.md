# Gambler's Fallacy Social Science Experiment for ENG101 

Hi there!

Here before you are three different folders:
* Wheel.zip: holds a working exe file that you should be able to run on a windows machine

* WheelCode.zip: which holds the original source code that can be looked over 

  - **NOTE**: will require the Unity Game Engine to be installed to see everything together, but you should be able to look at the individual components, such as the code itself)

  - **NOTE**: the source code may also be a bit illegible, so bare that in mind, if something looks confusing

* docs: hold a template spreadsheet that can be used to replicate the experiment, along with the results of my experiment in a similar spreadsheet
